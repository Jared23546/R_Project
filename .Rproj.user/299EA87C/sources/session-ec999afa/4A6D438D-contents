Describe the most unique or funny way someone else showed you love or provided you a service and why you're grateful for that act.

Your answer: My wife scratches my back when we watch movies. She doesnt super love to do it but she knows I like it when she does scratch my back I am very grateful. I'm sure that there is a better example but right now I cannot think of one haha.
